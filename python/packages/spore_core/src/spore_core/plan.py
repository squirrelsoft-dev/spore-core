"""Issue #70 — Plan phase / plan artifact (PlanExecute, phase 1 of 2).

Mirrors the Rust reference at ``rust/crates/spore-core/src/plan.rs``.

This module owns the *capture* half of the PlanExecute plan phase: turning a
planner model's ``FinalResponse`` text into a structured :class:`PlanArtifact`.
The *phase driver* itself (``StandardHarness._run_plan_phase``) lives on the
harness because it needs the harness's turn machinery; this module supplies the
deterministic, total text→artifact step and the phase error type.

Public surface:

* :class:`PlanArtifact` — re-exported from :mod:`spore_core.hooks`; the
  existing, serializable contract (``{tasks: list[str], rationale: str}``) that
  is the payload of the ``OnPlanCreated`` hook. This issue REUSES it rather than
  defining a competing type. It is the contract consumed by #72 / #59.
* :class:`PlanPhaseError` — error type for the plan phase.
* :func:`capture_plan_artifact` — the model-text → :class:`PlanArtifact` capture
  function. Deterministic and total: never raises an unexpected error; malformed
  input raises :class:`PlanPhaseError` with ``kind == "unparseable_plan"``.

Resolved spec decisions (all four FINAL — match the Rust reference):

* **Q1 (model routing):** ``HarnessConfig.planner_agent`` plus a
  ``HarnessBuilder.planner_agent`` setter. When the strategy is ``PlanExecute``
  and ``planner_agent`` is set, the plan turn runs on it; otherwise on the
  default ``config.agent``. ``plan_model`` stays DESCRIPTIVE metadata only.
* **Q2 (HITL):** The plan phase ALWAYS runs to completion. It fires
  ``OnPlanCreated`` synchronously (the hook may rewrite the artifact); the
  stored artifact reflects any mutation. No pause / no ``WaitingForHuman``.
* **Q3 (capture grammar):** JSON-in-response. Trim ASCII whitespace; strip a
  single leading ```` ``` ````/```` ```json ```` fence line and a single
  trailing ```` ``` ```` fence if present; parse a JSON object with ``tasks``
  (required array of strings, kept verbatim, may be empty) and ``rationale``
  (optional string, default ``""``). Any failure → :class:`PlanPhaseError`
  (``unparseable_plan``).
* **Q4 (terminal RunResult):** After producing, firing ``OnPlanCreated``, and
  storing the artifact, the ``PlanExecute`` arm hands off to the execute loop
  (issue #59), which drains the parsed task list. A well-formed but empty plan
  halts with ``HaltReasonEmptyPlan``.
